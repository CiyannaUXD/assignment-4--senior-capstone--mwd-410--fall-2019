# Fall 2019 Senior Capstone ‚Äî Assignment 4 (Final Implementation, using MongoDB, Express, Nunjucks, and Node)

* **Do not edit this file.**  
* **Do not start this project until you have read these instructions carefully.**

## Introduction
In this last sprint, you and your team will implement the final stage of your project, using Mongo, Express, Nunjucks, and Node.

---

## Before You Begin
1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Fork this repo(sitory). See [this video](http://code-warrior.github.io/tutorials/git/github/forking-and-cloning-at-the-github-web-site/) on how to carry out this step and step `3`.
3. Clone your fork, using either the web site or the GitHub Desktop client.
4. Checkout your personalized branch, the one with your name and GitHub user handle.

## Repo Ownership
The ownership and collaboration structure implemented for all previous assignments remain in place.

---

## Sprint Planning
Continue to follow all the rules associated with sprint planning that you‚Äôve practiced thus far.

---

## The Rules
* Only create a development track; a production track is not needed. (Assume development *is* production.)
* You may choose Gulp or plain Node to implement your project.
    * If you choose Gulp, then your entire project should be stood up by the command `gulp serve`.
    * If you choose Node, then your entire project should be stood up by the command `npm run dev`.
* You‚Äôre encouraged to use Sass, but, if it saves you time, you may write straight CSS.
* You must use Sass variables in Sass or CSS variables in CSS for colors, widths, heights, and font stacks.
    * If you use Sass, place them in a partial called `_variables.scss`.
    * If you use CSS, place them in a file called `variables.css`.
* Passwords must be salted.
* Only submit files required by your project; edit `.gitignore` accordingly.

## Extra Credit
1. If, in addition to your development track, you also implement a production track ‚Äî and all that a production track implies as it pertains to a web application ‚Äî and the project is GitHub Pages-ready, namely `https://USER.github.io`, then an increase of 1/3rd of a grade will be applied **to your overall final grade**.
2. If you complete the project by Monday, 16 December, at 11:00 AM, and the grade for the final project is A or better, then an increase of 1/3rd of a grade will be applied **to your overall final grade**.
3. If `1` is implemented as part of `2`, then an increase of 1/3rd of a grade will be applied to your final project‚Äôs grade before `2` is applied.
